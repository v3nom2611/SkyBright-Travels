                            <h4><u> Welcome to North Male Atoll </u></h4> <br>Tourism is well developed in North Male Atoll, which includes the tiny single-island atolls of Gaafaru Falhu and Kaashidhoo to its north. Maldivian tourism began here with the resort
                            of Kurumba opening its doors in 1972, and many of the resorts in North Male are grand dames in the scope of the country's relatively recent conversion to luxury travel destination. As well as having many of the best known resorts,
                            these days there are many inhabited islands that are now home to thriving guesthouse scenes.

                                    Hulhumalé grew through the conjuring up of land from a lagoon situated in Hulhulé, the main International hub of Maldives. As Hulhumalé was developed as an expansion of Malé City, situated in Hulhulé lagoon, a combined name was given- Hulhumalé.
                                    The City will acquaint a global lifestyle, focused on investing for the long-term future, nurturing the youthful talent and most of all forming new traditions for the anticipated 240,000 people.
                                    Hulhumalé is the culmination of the island nation’s eﬀorts to reimagine its focus towards being resilient, economically and environmentally.

                                Artificial Beach, Male is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking human-made seashores in the Maldives and for a very good purpose. With breathtaking views and a pleasant climate, this seaside, formed like a crescent, has earned its spot as one of the most popular and preferred tourist destinations. The beach is located on the eastern seafront of the island and is very near to the Male city’s recreational centre. At first glance, the beach does not appear to be an artificial one and in fact, even though the water is not as deep as it is on the natural beaches, it is a famed swimming spot for the locals and visitors due to its lush blue Maldivian waters.
